NIABrowser v1.1.1 — Smarter AI, Better UX

NEW:
- AI Target Selector: Switch between your open tabs directly from the AI chat — ask AI about any page without leaving the conversation
- Per-Site Context Memory: Each tab remembers its own attachment selections (cookies, network, console). Switching tabs preserves your choices
- 6 New AI Models: GPT-5 Mini, GPT-5.1 Codex Mini, Arcee Coder Large, Grok 4 Fast, Grok 4.1 Fast, Grok Code Fast
- Model Management: Full model browser in Settings with cost tiers, input/output pricing, max tokens. Edit or remove any model
- Dynamic Tab Bar: Tabs auto-resize based on count — full-width when few, compact and scrollable when many

IMPROVED:
- New tab page refreshed with Demo button and cleaner quick access layout
- Settings model/provider forms render inline — no more floating overlays
- AI context panel now scrollable — Done button always visible
- App always uses your selected model (removed hardcoded fallbacks)

FIXED:
- Android system navigation bar no longer overlaps bottom UI
- New tabs open to blank page instead of Google.com
- About screen version now reads correctly from package.json
```
