## Common Rejection Reasons & How to Avoid

| Risk | Solution |
|------|----------|
| "Browser app" extra scrutiny | Emphasize it's a **developer tool**, not a general browser. The description positions it as a development utility. |
| JavaScript execution concerns | We say "run JavaScript" and "script automation" — never "inject" or "exploit". Scripts are user-created for their own use. |
| API key storage | Keys stored locally via AsyncStorage. Mention in Data Safety that no keys are transmitted to your servers. |
| Missing privacy policy | Must have a live privacy policy URL before submitting. Already at browser.niascript.com/privacy.html |
| Permissions justification | INTERNET: required for browsing. STORAGE: for screenshot saving and data export. Explain each in Data Safety. |
